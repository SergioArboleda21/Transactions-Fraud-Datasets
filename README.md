# Transactions-Fraud-Datasets
This project addresses transactional fraud using an unsupervised anomaly detection model, as the initial dataset lacked fraud labels. An IsolationForest algorithm identifies outliers based on engineered features like user spending patterns and transaction timing. The outcome is an actionable report prioritizing suspicious activity.
